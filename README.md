I'm Augusto Sasso, founder of the Patag startup:

I'm looking to build a team of Python programmers who want to jump into big projects as freelancers.
Why am I proposing this? In short, I was no longer convinced of my career and I left it to dedicate
myself to programming as a self-taught person. That is why I would like to put together this team, a
team of 3 programmers and myself, with the following advantages:

1. Work with the security of a team: Work on projects that only one person could take a long time. Do
you have a question during the project? You consult it with your team and learn while you work. Of
course, working with a team also means less errors in our programming since we're all for each other,
so less individual pressure.

2. Enlarge your portfolio: Being part of larger projects that could be presented, for example, by
companies, is worth much more than an accumulation of small projects.

3. Higher pay: Obviously being part of bigger projects also brings bigger pay. Am I interested in
charging a higher percentage of the project for being the representative or "boss"? Not at all, we all
receive 25% of the total. Plus, if the project offers +$500, devs get 30% of the total pay.

4. Charge without commissions: Working as a freelancer means paying certain money to the website for
promoting us as a talent that a client can come across. It may not be a lot of money, maybe ~5% - 10%,
but it snowballs in the long run. What I propose as a rep is that I pay the commission with my 25% and
that the rest of the team collect 25% of the total net earnings, in other words: one less tax for you.

5. No need to negotiate with the client: That will be part of my job and the team will focus on
programming.

6. My interest is not money: My greatest aspiration is to learn to program with team projects, that is
my goal. Therefore I am not bothered in paying the website commission, since my profit also comes from
learning.

If you're interested or have any doubts, feel free to contact me.
